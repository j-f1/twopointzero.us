start by describing what an ecosystem, which is short for ecological system, is</B>. 
Imagine yourself standing in the middle of a forest observing <I><B>everything</B></I> 
around you. You will see a group of plants, animals, soil, sunlight, air, water, 
minerals, and nutrients<SUP><A HREF="#note1">1</A></SUP>. The plants and animals 
in that forest depend on each other for survival. What is more difficult to see 
are the interrelationships between the living organisms (some which can't be seen 
without a microscope) and the <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('environment')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('environment')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">environment</a>. The dependencies between all 
of these elements can be very complex. Complex systems like this, with different 
organisms and their interrelationships with the physical environment and contained 
in a specific unit of space (or area) are called ecosystems. &quot;Contained in 
a specific unit of space&quot; means that all the elements in the ecosystem might 
have intricate and complex <A href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('interd')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('interd')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">interdependencies</A> between each other but 
only within the <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('confines')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('confines')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">confines</a> of that space and independent 
from anything outside the area. Of course, things like the energy radiated by 
the sun or the climate and air are special cases. Ecologists are scientists that 
study complex ecosystems with the fine and interesting dependencies amongst all 
the different elements. Their objective is to understand what every element brings 
into the system and what every element needs from the system. They try to understand, 
from a scientific point of view, what keeps everything living and existing in 
a balanced and stable way for very long periods of time. By the time you finish 
this lesson you will have gained a good appreciation of this. </P><P><B>What is 
a population?</B> Very simply, a population is a group of organisms of the same 
species that live in a particular area. The number of organisms in a population 
changes over time because of the following: births, deaths, <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('immigration')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('immigration')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">immigration</a>, and <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('emigration')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('emigration')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">emigration</a>. Of course, births and immigration 
increase the size of the population; whereas, deaths and emigration decrease the 
size. The increase in the number of organisms in a population is referred to as 
population growth. There are factors that can help populations grow and others 
than can slow down and even prevent populations from growing. Factors that limit 
population growth are called limiting factors. However, before we go into the 
limiting factors, let's talk about the <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('biotic')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('biotic')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">biotic</a> potential of a population.</P><P>If 
<a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('idealsit')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('idealsit')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">things were perfect</A> for a population and 
all the individuals in the population survived and reproduced at the maximum rate, 
that <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('growthrate')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('growthrate')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">growth rate</a> is called the biotic potential. 
The biotic potential is used as a reference when looking at growth rates of populations. 
Are the growth rates close to the biotic potential or far from it and how far? 
That type of analysis helps population ecologists understand if the conditions 
for the population are adequate.</P><P>It is certainly not common for a population 
to grow at its biotic potential for a considerable period of time; however, there 
are situations where this can happen. For example, when fish are introduced into 
a lake where there is plenty of food and space and there are no <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('predators')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('predators')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">predators</a>, the fish can reproduce at their 
biotic potential, but not for a long time. Another example is when a scientist 
grows <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('ecoli')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('ecoli')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()"><I>E. coli</I></a><SUP><A HREF="#note2">2</A></SUP> 
on a <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('petridish')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('petridish')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">petri dish</a> with ideal nutrients. The bacteria 
will reproduce and grow at its biotic potential, which for E. coli means that 
the population doubles in size every 20 minutes!. The graph of a population growing 
at its biotic potential, which is called exponential, can be very steep. The <A HREF="facts_math.html#expgraph">graph</A> 
and the mathematical equations, which represent this kind of growth, are included 
in the <A HREF="facts_math.html#unlimited" TARGET="">Facts about Population Growth 
Mathematical Models</A> page.</P><P>For the two previous examples as well as for 
all <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('populations')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('populations')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">populations</a>, there are factors that will 
limit their growth. Some of these factors depend on the <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('populationdens')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('populationdens')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">population density</a>. The most common density-dependent 
factors that limit population growth are:</P><UL><LI><B>Food and water supplies</B> 
- A given supply of food and water might be enough for a small population density. 
However, that same supply might not be enough for a high-density population, and 
competition among the individuals of the population would develop.</LI><LI><B>Light</B> 
- Light is a very common resource needed by plants. A plant density increases 
those plants that don't get enough light will not grow strong enough and might 
even die. </LI><LI><B>Space</B> - This is an obvious limiting factor, especially 
if you think of fish in a lake, bacteria in a petri dish, or plants in a forest.</LI><LI><B>Predators</B> 
- Higher densities of a <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('prey')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('prey')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">prey</a> population attract more predators 
and as the number of prey increases, so does the number of predators. On the other 
hand, if the number of prey decreases, so does the number of predators.</LI><LI><B>Diseases</B> 
- Diseases can certainly have an impact on birth rate and thus affect growth rate. 
Since many diseases are contagious, they are therefore dependent on density.</LI><LI><B>Parasitism</B> 
- Parasitism is a relationship where one organism (the parasite) feeds on the 
tissues or body fluids of another organism (the host). In this type of relationship 
the parasite benefits and the host is harmed, sometimes to the point of killing 
the host. Like diseases, since parasites spread easier in a high-density host, 
their impact depends on the density.</LI></UL><P>There are also limiting factors 
that don't depend on the population density. These density-independent factors 
are <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('abiotic')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('abiotic')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">abiotic</a> factors such as weather storms, 
fires, earthquakes, or floods. Any of these factors can have a severe impact on 
population sizes regardless of density. </P><P><A NAME="carrying"></A>To conclude 
this section, we will describe the carrying capacity of an ecosystem. The area 
occupied by a population does not have unlimited resources such as food, water, 
and supplies to build and keep a <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('dwelling')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('dwelling')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">dwelling</a>. These factors limit the population 
growth and many times bring about death rates that equal the birth rates. When 
this happens, the population size reaches a stable balance. So one could say that 
there is a certain number of individuals of the population that can be supported 
by the environmental resources in a given ecosystem. That is called the carrying 
capacity of that ecosystem. The graph of a population that grows until it reaches 
a stable size based on the carrying capacity of the ecosystem is called an S-shaped 
curve. The <A HREF="facts_math.html#sgraph">graph</A> and the mathematical equations, 
which represent this kind of growth, are included in the <A HREF="facts_math.html#sigmoid" TARGET="">Facts
