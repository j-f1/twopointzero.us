QUESTION
Open this box by clicking with the mouse on the
tab, holding it down, and moving it to the right
ANSWER
You will find boxes like this throughout the 
lesson. The boxes could be setup to require a 
special key before one could open them.  Let me 
know if you think that it might be a good idea  
to "lock" some of the boxes.
