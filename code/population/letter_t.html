for Teachers</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Dear teacher or parent,</P><P>The 
purpose of this letter is to describe the objective of this lesson as well as 
to give you some ideas of how to use it with the students.</P><P>One of the strong 
objectives of this multi-disciplinary lesson is not to simply state facts and 
examples as you find in many biological science texts, but rather for the student 
to become aware of the facts by doing experiments and uncovering the facts themselves. 
An example of this is the ecological pyramid. The student will be exposed to the 
notion that a given number of oak trees can only support a limited number of squirrels 
by doing an experiment.</P><P>Another objective that I&nbsp;had when making this 
lesson was to awaken the scientific instinct in the students. If this lesson helps 
any student to pursue a scientific field, I'll be very pleased.</P><P> This lesson 
is pretty broad in its scope. Before using it you may want to go through the whole 
material and give specific directions to the students on how to go about it. For 
example, if you really want to emphasize math, you'll probably want to make sure 
that the students go over the <A HREF="facts_math.html">Facts about Population 
Growth Mathematical Models</A> page. Something else that you might want to consider 
is to ask the students to write down their hypothesis for each experiment before 
running it and then share them or discuss them in class.</P><P>I would expect 
that it might take somewhere between six and eight hours for the students to go 
through the whole lesson, depending on what percentage of the material they cover. 
One suggestion is to break the lesson into three different portions to be covered 
in different days. The students could read each portion at home or in a computer 
lab followed by in-class discussions.</P><P>Throughout the lesson you will see 
20 boxes that hide answers and hints. These boxes can be locked with a key so 
that you as a teacher control when they can see the answers. I&nbsp;am considering 
adding keys to the boxes that provide answers to the experiments (the ones in 
the &quot;Theory&quot; sections), but I would first like to hear what you think. 
Please <A HREF="../mailform.html">let me know</A>.</P><P>I would really appreciate 
it if you <A HREF="../mailform.html">provide me feedback</A> on your actual experience, 
which I might include in here for other teachers to use. Also, please feel free 
to let me know if there are any additional words that&nbsp;should be included 
in the on-line dictionary.</P><P>Sincerely,<BR><I><A HREF="mailto:jacobo@arcytech.org">Jacobo
