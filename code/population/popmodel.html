Physical System</B>. We will start by describing the physical system that we will 
be working with. Try to use your imagination to feel that you are part of the 
system being analyzed. As described before, we will be working in a forest full 
of oak trees. Imagine yourself in one such forest. You are all alone, walking 
among some very huge oak trees. You notice that some trees are smaller both in 
diameter as well as in height. As a matter of fact, some of the trees look like 
they <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('sprouted')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('sprouted')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">sprouted</a> not that long ago, as they are 
almost as tall as you are. As you walk, you step on many leaves that have fallen 
from the trees and enjoy the sound that you produce as you step on them. As you 
concentrate on your steps, you notice the feeling of some hard little rocks. As 
you hunch down to grab one, you realize that they are not little rocks but acorns. 
You look up to see where they came from and you immediately see many of them hanging 
from the branches of the oak trees. You continue walking for a few minutes, with 
oak trees all around you, until you decide to sit down, lean your back on one 
of the trees, and simply enjoy the great view and wonderful fragrance of the forest. 
It is so pleasant, so quiet, that you wish you could stay here forever.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/oaklean.jpg"></P><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/oaks.jpg" WIDTH="471" HEIGHT="360"></P><P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">It 
is a bit dark because the <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('canopy')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('canopy')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">canopy</a> of the big trees, with its lush 
branches, leaves very little room for the sun rays to penetrate into the area 
where you are sitting. All of a sudden you hear a hurried <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('shrill')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('shrill')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">shrill</a> sound. You quickly turn your head 
towards the unexpected noise to try to find out where it came from, and see a 
very cute little gray squirrel going at a very fast speed up the trunk of one 
of the trees. Within a few seconds the squirrel disappears inside a hole high 
up in the tree. You keep looking at the hole hoping to see the squirrel again. 
A few moments later you see the squirrel's head pop out of the hole with one of 
the acorns in its mouth. </P><P ALIGN="LEFT">After some time of observing all 
that is going on around you, you notice that squirrels keep coming down the trees, 
grabbing acorns, and quickly taking them up to their dwellings. You are enjoying 
seeing them hard at work, when again there is a startling noise. This time it 
comes from up above in the air. When you see a huge red-tail hawk, you very quickly 
recognize the noise to be the fluttering of its unexpectedly big wings. Almost 
at the same time that you see the hawk landing on one of the tree branches, you 
realize that you are not the only one that noticed it. All the squirrels disappeared 
as if by magic. They know what the hawk is after!</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>The Population 
Computer Model</B>. The computer model implemented for this lesson does not exactly 
represent the forest that was described in the previous section. Even though it 
attempts to model the real physical system accurately, its main purpose is to 
promote understanding of the relationship and interdependence of the three species 
(oak trees, squirrels, and hawks) by allowing you to make choices and decisions 
on how to set things up to control the model. In using it you will learn interesting 
facts about the different species. You will learn additional facts from reading 
the different <A HREF="index.html#facts" TARGET="">fact pages</A>. In this model 
you begin with a forest; except that it is not a forest because there are no trees 
at all, so you really start with empty ground that measures 600 feet by 250 feet. 
You start by deciding three things: the number of oak trees that you want to plant, 
the amount of water to use for watering (of course, this is rainfall water, not 
tap water), and the nutrients needed for proper growth. Next, you can decide how 
many gray squirrels are born or introduced into the area and when. Lastly, you 
decide how many red-tail hawks are born and when.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">You make 
all of these decisions, which in computer model lingo is referred to as defining 
the initial conditions for the system, and you then let time advance. As time 
moves forward, you can dynamically see the trees begin to grow as well as the 
squirrels and hawks appear, reproduce and grow, etc. Depending on the initial 
conditions you might end up with nothing at all, i.e. none of the species might 
grow at all. The whole idea is that by interacting with the model and reading 
the <A HREF="index.html#facts" TARGET="">facts</A>, you will be able to learn 
what it takes to evolve the forest and its inhabitants into well balanced populations. 
Since, as mentioned before, the model is not intended to be 100% accurate, throughout 
the lesson and the facts pages you will also learn some of the real factors and 
conditions that are not being used by the model.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">The last step 
before starting to work with the model is reading the specific instructions on 
how to use the model. Proceed to the next page to read these instructions. Right 
after the instructions page you will be able to start working with the model.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="80%" CELLPADDING="5"><TR ALIGN="CENTER"><TD WIDTH="31%" ALIGN="LEFT"><P><A HREF="models.html"><IMG
