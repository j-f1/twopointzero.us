QUESTION
What is the purpose for obtaining an equation such as
this?  (Think a little before opening the box)
ANSWER
Having an equation or formula that describes the
behavior of a system allows you to predict what will
happen. For example, you can easily and accurately
figure out the number of acorns produced on any given
year. If you had an equation that related acorn
production to a specific nutrient and the acorn
production was lower than expected you could use the
equation to figure out how much nutrient could be added
to increase production to a normal level.
