QUESTION
What is the life expectancy of the red-tail hawks?
ANSWER
One experiment to figure this out is to start with 20
trees and introduce four squirrels in year 30.  You 
then wait until the squirrel population size grows to
a good level and introduce one single hawk, which can
not reproduce, in year 85.  After running this 
experiment you'll notice in the table that the hawk is
no longer in the forest by the year 105.  Hawks can 
only die because of the lack of squirrels (their prey)
or old age.  In this experiment one can see that the
single hawk does not affect the squirrel population,
so one can conclude that the hawk died because of old
age at an age of 20.
END
