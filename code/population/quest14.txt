QUESTION
How many squirrels can a single Oak tree sustain?
ANSWER
Again, based on the number of the previous experiment,
if 30 full-grown trees can produce 66,000 acorns per
year, then each tree produces 66,000/30 = 2,200 acorns
per year. Since each squirrel needs about 825 acorns
each year, we can conclude that each tree can sustain
2,200 / 825 = 2.66 squirrels.  Since you can not have 
portions (0.66) of a squirrel, we can say that each tree
can sustain somewhere between two and three squirrels.
END
