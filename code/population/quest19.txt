QUESTION
How many hawks does it take to impact the squirrel
population balance?
ANSWER
As soon as you try two hawks, you'll notice that they
impact the squirrel population.  The reason is that the
hawks will reproduce (as it assumes one to be a male
and the other a female) and as their number increases,
so does their need for more prey.
