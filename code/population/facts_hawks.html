definitions</B> -- The Hawk's scientific name is <I>Buteo jamaicensis</I>. The 
genus <I>Buteo</I> is from the Latin buteo (broad rounded wings). The specific 
name <I>jamaicensis</I> is named for Jamaica, the country, and from the Latin 
­ensis (which means belonging to a place). This refers to the range of the hawk, 
extending from Alaska to the West Indies. The Hawk is a bird of <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('prey')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('prey')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">prey</a> and those types of birds are called 
raptors. The young ones, when they have their first complete <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('plumage')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('plumage')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">plumage</a>, are called immature.</P><P><B>Sizes</B> 
-- Their length is 17 to 22 inches with an average of 19 inches. Their wingspread, 
depending on the species, ranges from 43 to 56 inches. Their weight ranges from 
1.5 to 3.3 pounds, averaging 2.4 pounds.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Colors</B> -- Adults 
are typically dark brown and the immature ones are gray brown. There are five 
different species of Hawks in the United states and several more around the world. 
Their colors vary slightly. They have a quite noticeable shade of red on their 
tail end. A few species are black, but it is rare.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Where 
do they live?</B> &nbsp;Hawks are a very common type of bird that can be found 
in every habitat in North America except in the high arctic and in extensive tracts 
of dense forests. The ones that live in the far north migrate south in autumn 
(when the cool days begin). They can get down all the way to Mexico and South 
America. They don't stay in the snow and ice. They return in the spring, which 
is the breeding season. Hawks live in both open and wooded areas, particularly 
wood edges. They are often seen perched conspicuously on a treetop.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Reproduction</B> 
-- Hawks start breeding when they are one year old. The breeding season is in 
the spring, and the eggs are laid six to eight weeks later. The mother keeps the 
eggs warm for about a month before they are born in the late spring. There are 
normally three eggs in a <A HREF="javascript:dictionary.startIt('nestling')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" ONMOUSEOVER="dictionary.startIt ('nestling')"
ONMOUSEOUT="dictionary.clearIt ()">nestling</A>. Weasels sometimes attack the 
nest, killing and/or eating the nestling.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Flight</B> -- 
Active flight is with slow, steady, and deep wing beats. Hawks <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('soar')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('soar')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">soar</a> with wings raised slightly above horizontal. 
They <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('hover')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('hover')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">hover</a> and <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('kite')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('kite')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">kite</a> on moderate wind. </P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><A NAME="eating"></A>Eating</B> 
-- While still young and living in the nest, hawks will eat worms and beetles. 
They will also eat frogs, mice and snakes. As they get older, hawks prey mainly 
on rodents but also on insects and their <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('larvae')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('larvae')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">larvae</a>, fish, and larger mammals such a 
rabbits, hares, and <I>squirrels</I>. They will also eat <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('carrion')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('carrion')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">carrion</a>.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">If a hawk finishes 
a meal with their crop bulging, it may not hunt again for a day or two. The crop 
is a pouch halfway between the mouth and the stomach, where food is stored and 
gradually released to the stomach. The crop maintains the steady flow of food 
needed to sustain these big birds.</P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="85%" ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD WIDTH="7%" VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="images/arrow.gif" WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="TOP" BORDER="0"></TD><TD WIDTH="93%">One 
assumption made in the program is that each hawk eats three squirrels per year, 
that is, it needs at least three to survive. This is a BIG assumption because 
hawks eat many other things and if they don't find food in an area they move until 
they find it. It is also interesting to know that hawks might attack and kill 
a squirrel but only eat small portions of it. The three squirrels per year assumption 
was added to have a strong relationship and dependency between the two species. 
In reality there is a relationship, but it is much more complex -- that involves 
many more species.</TD></TR></TABLE><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>Vision</B> 
-- Hawk's vision is much better than humans. They can see spiders and beetles 
from afar. Hawks can see a mouse from a height of one mile.</P><P><B>How old do 
they live?</B> -- The hawk's average life span in the wild is 20 years.</P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="85%" ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD WIDTH="7%" VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="images/arrow.gif" WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="TOP" BORDER="0"></TD><TD WIDTH="93%">In 
the program, hawks die of old age (when they reach 20 years) or from lack of food 
(that is, less than three squirrels per year).</TD></TR></TABLE><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B><A NAME="deaths"></A>Predators</B> 
-- They have few, if any, natural predators, but they have enemies such as pollution, 
particularly from pesticides, and habitat destruction from developments. In short, 
humans are their main predators.</P><P><B>Causes of death</B> -- In addition to 
their predators, young hawks can die from learning to fly or eating big snakes.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>References</B>
