-- </P><P>This program gives you a birds-eye view of a field where you can plant 
oak trees. By letting time pass the trees will grow to form a forest of trees. 
You can see the trees evolve and grow from above until they become full grown. 
You can also incorporate two different animal species, gray squirrels and red-tailed 
hawks, by deciding both the quantities of each as well as the year when they 
<a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('immigrate')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('immigrate')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">immigrate</a>
into the forest area. You can 
bring up a setup panel to define the conditions for the model and then simply 
clicks on the different control buttons below the forest field to advance or stop 
the time and to bring up a table and/or a chart to display the data. </P><P><B>Time 
resolution</B> -- </P><P>The time resolution is in years, which means that when 
you advance time it jumps a whole year with each click. It is as if you flew over 
the forest once a year, took a picture, and counted all the different items as 
part of the data collection. This data is the one presented in both the table 
and the graphs described below.</P><P>The following figure shows the image of 
the complete panel displayed by the model program:</P><P><IMG
        SRC="images/population.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" HSPACE="0"
        WIDTH="520" HEIGHT="319" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P><P>The brown panel in 
the figure represents an area of 600 by 250 ft or 150,000 ft<SUP>2</SUP>, which 
is close to three acres. It is in this piece of land that you can decide how many 
oak tree <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('seedling')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('seedling')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">seedlings</a> to plant. Since the spread of 
the crown of a full-grown oak tree can reach 50 ft in diameter, the maximum number 
of oak trees that can be planted is 60. The view that you get in this model is 
what is referred to as a birds-eye view; as if you were high above the field, 
at about one mile<SUP><A HREF="#note1">1</A></SUP> high. </P><P><B>Scale</B> -- 
</P><P>Let's talk a little bit about the scale. Computer screens have very small 
pixels, like little dots, used to paint images and text. If you look at some images 
very close you might be able to see the individual pixels. The scale used in this 
program is approximately one pixel for every foot, so the diameter of the crown 
of the full-grown tree is 50 pixels (or 50 feet). Using this scale you can imagine 
that the squirrels are going to be very, very small. In fact, they are represented 
using a single gray pixel. They might be difficult to spot, so watch carefully. 
The red-tailed hawks, even though also small, are very easy to spot. They are 
drawn as:</P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="140" CELLSPACING="4"><TR><TD HEIGHT="15">&nbsp;</TD><TD HEIGHT="15">&nbsp;</TD><TD HEIGHT="15" BGCOLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</TD><TD HEIGHT="15">&nbsp;</TD><TD HEIGHT="15">&nbsp;</TD><TD HEIGHT="15">&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR="#000000"><TD HEIGHT="10">&nbsp;</TD><TD HEIGHT="10">&nbsp;</TD><TD HEIGHT="10">&nbsp;</TD><TD HEIGHT="10">&nbsp;</TD><TD HEIGHT="10">&nbsp;</TD><TD HEIGHT="10" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD HEIGHT="3">&nbsp;</TD><TD HEIGHT="3">&nbsp;</TD><TD HEIGHT="3" BGCOLOR="#FF0000">&nbsp;</TD><TD HEIGHT="3">&nbsp;</TD><TD HEIGHT="3">&nbsp;</TD><TD HEIGHT="3">&nbsp;</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV><P>In 
the previous figure, each of the seven squares is represented on the program by 
a single pixel. As a comparison, the squares above are drawn as 23 by 23 pixels 
squares. Therefore, a hawk's wing span in the model is five feet.</P><P><B><A NAME="controls"></A>Controls</B>

be used to control the program. The following table describes the actions associated

can step forward the time by a single year (with the <I>play</I> button) or get

button to go back to the normal window.</P><P>The next three pages in this lesson 
give directions on how to set it up to be able to model different situations and 
conditions.</P><CENTER><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><P><B><A NAME="table"></A>Reading the 
Table</B> -- </P><P>As described in the <A HREF="#controls">controls table</A> 
above, clicking on the <I>table</I> button brings up the table with all the data. 
Clicking on the button again or on the window's X will make the window go away. 
You can bring the table up and make it go away as needed. The table can also be 
up as the program is running, and it will be updated accordingly. The table and 
its data are always kept <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('insynch')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('insynch')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">in synch</a> with the actual model.</P><P>The 
main advantage of the table is that it presents the data with precision. You can 
find out exactly how many acorns were produced or how many squirrels were alive 
on any given year. The disadvantage is that it is not that easy to visualize how 
the data evolves or how the different columns relate to each other. That is why 
graphs, described in the next section, are also included as part of the model.</P><P><B><A NAME="graphs"></A>Reading 
the Graphs</B> -- </P></DIV></CENTER><P>Everything that was described for the 
table window in the previous section applies to the graph window. Of course, the 
big difference is that the graphs only let you read the data approximately, but 
let you visualize it very easily. You can see the dependency of one curve on the 
others, see how they each evolve over time, etc.</P><P>Several important things 
need to be mentioned about the graph. The graphs plot time in years on the X-axis 
(the horizontal one). One nice feature is that the scale of the X-axis gets automatically 
readjusted depending on the amount of data. When you have data for a few years 
on the chart, the dots are spread apart. &nbsp;However, when the amount of data 
increases, as the model continues evolving in time, the scale changes to bring 
the points closer together and fit more on the same space.</P><P>On the Y-axis 
(the vertical one) the graph plots three variables or three sets of data: the 
number of acorns, squirrels, and hawks. It should be obvious that each of the 
three variables needs different scales as the numbers of acorns go into the thousands 
while the number of hawks remains in the low tens. Do you see the problem? A simple 
way to solve this is to have one scale in percent from the total and annotate 
the three different totals in the chart. What this means is that the Y-axis goes 
from 0% to 100% for each of the variables. If you know that 100% of the number 
of acorns is 7,000 and you see a point representing the number of acorns at about 
35%, then you can read the number as 7,000 x 0.35 = 2,450 acorns. The next example 
uses the following graph:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
                SRC="images/y_axis.gif" WIDTH="215"
                HEIGHT="221" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P><P ALIGN="LEFT">To figure 
out how many hawks the single dot on the graph represents, you multiply 30 (which 
represents 100% of the hawks) by 0.25 (because the point is at 25%) to obtain 
about 7 or 8 hawks. Of course you can also visually estimate the number.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">Depending 
on the browser being used, the window with the graphs might not show the Max values 
at the bottom initially. If that is the case you simply have to enlarge the window 
a bit by pulling the bottom margin down.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">One final note, the 
curves might sometimes look very steep, i.e. going up or down very rapidly, but 
remember that each consecutive dot or point in the chart is really one year or 
365 days apart.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><U>Remember these important things</U>:</P><OL><LI>For 
the exact numbers you can always go to the <A HREF="#table">table</A>. </LI><LI>Each 
of the three different curves has a <I>different scale</I> as indicated by the 
Max values. If the point for the hawks is very close to the point for the acorns, 
that doesn't mean that the values are close!</LI><LI>The purpose of having the 
three curves on the same graph is to see how they relate to each other and how 
they evolve over time.</LI></OL><P>&nbsp;</P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="70%" CELLPADDING="5"><TR ALIGN="CENTER"><TD WIDTH="31%" ALIGN="LEFT"><P><A HREF="popmodel.html"><IMG
