QUESTION
What is the life expectancy of a squirrel?
ANSWER
One experiment to figure this out is to place a single
squirrel, which can not reproduce and have baby
squirrels, at a point in time when there are enough
acorns for it to survive.  Since the population model
assumes that a newly introduced squirrel was just born,
by advancing the time and checking when the squirrel is
no longer alive you can determine how many years it
lived.  In the model squirrels live 12 years.
