QUESTION
Why is it that when the balance breaks one can end up
with only squirrels but not with only hawks?
ANSWER
The squirrels do not depend on the hawks for survival,
quite the opposite. If all the hawks disappear, the
squirrel population increases in numbers.  The reverse
is not true as the hawks, under the conditions
considered in the model, depend on squirrels for
survival.  No squirrels, no hawks!
END
