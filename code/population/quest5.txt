QUESTION
How much water does a single oak tree need per year and
what nutrients are necessary for its healthy growth?
ANSWER
A full grown Oak Tree needs an amazing 20,000
gallons of water per year, or on the average, 55 
gallons per day. That is a lot of rain!  Regarding the
nutrients, it needs all of the nutrients available in
the model. Figuring out the nutrient list is not a fair 
question, even though it is pretty simple to figure
out using the model (right?).  The important thing
to realize is that oak trees need a very diverse set
of nutrients for proper growth, each one beneficial 
for a different aspect.  You can find out more
details from the oak trees Facts Page.
