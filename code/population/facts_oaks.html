to interesting facts about oak trees, this page includes a description of the 
differences between the assumptions made in the population model applet and the 
real thing. At the end of the page you'll find references to other sites to learn 
more about trees and forests.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/oaktree2.jpg" ALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="181" HEIGHT="166" BORDER="5"></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Names 
and definitions</B> -- Oak trees are a type of deciduous tree. These are broad-leaved 
trees that shed all their leaves during one season. Forests which are primarily 
composed of deciduous trees are called deciduous forests. The oak tree is a member 
of the Beech family and its scientific name is <I>Quercus</I> or <I>Lithocarpus</I>. 
The best type of soil for a healthy and nutritious growth of deciduous trees is 
referred to as podzol (also spelled podsol).</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>How old do 
they live?</B> -- Oak trees can live 200 or more years. The largest oak tree of 
record is the Wye oak in the community of Wye Mills in Talbot County on Maryland's 
eastern shore in the U.S.A. It is believed to be more than 400 years old, and 
it measures 9 meters (~ 32 feet) in circumference, it is 31 meters (~ 105 feet) 
tall with a crown spread of 48.1 meters (~ 158 feet).</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Nutrients 
</B> -- It is common to refer to the nutrients given to plants as plant food, 
although that is not technically correct. Plants need basic inorganic elements 
which they use to manufacture usable food and lock in the sun's energy into it. 
Here is a list of the different mineral nutrients needed by oak trees and their 
basic functions:</P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE BORDER="1" WIDTH="75%" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2"><TR><TD><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Mineral

up water through their root system. Some of the water evaporates from the leaves 
in a process called transpiration.</P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="85%" ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD WIDTH="7%" VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="images/arrow.gif" WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="TOP" BORDER="0"></TD><TD WIDTH="93%">In 
the population program if you don't select all the nutrients and all the water 
required for proper growth, the tree leaves will grow yellow (more yellow the 
less water and nutrients). Under these conditions, the acorn production will only 
reach a percentage of their full potential. At some point because of lack of nutrients 
and/or water, the trees will not grow at all and will not produce any acorns. 
After looking at the previous table you now know that lacking a specific nutrient 
affects a different aspect of the tree development. Also, when not enough water 
or not all nutrients are available, the trees will grow much slower and smaller 
but will not stop growing.</TD></TR></TABLE><P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B><A NAME="acornprod"></A>Acorn 
Production</B> -- Oak trees can start producing acorns when they are 20 years 
old, but sometimes can go all the way to 50 years for the first production. By 
the time the tree is 70 to 80 years old it will produce thousands of acorns.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">The 
oak trees produce acorns once a year during the fall. Acorn production varies 
year to year and normally alternates. Not even the healthiest and largest oak 
can accumulate enough food and energy to produce strong crops two years in succession. 
Real strong acorn productions might happen every four to ten years. In addition, 
a late spring frost can <A HREF="javascript:dictionary.startIt('blight')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" ONMOUSEOVER="dictionary.startIt ('blight')"

production will increase year after year; following a similar pattern as the size 
of the tree's canopy. The following graph shows what a typical production for 
an oak tree might be -- assuming no drastic jumps, which happen from time to time. 
The chart shows that production starts very slowly at around the 25<SUP>th</SUP> 
year, the number of acorns produced then accelerates, and when the tree reaches 
about 100 years of age, it starts slowing down until it reaches a yearly production 
of about 2,200 acorns per year.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG

can see, it is not a simple formula. You probably recognize the 25 and the 2200 
representing the year when the production starts and the maximum acorn production 
respectively. You may be wondering why the curve in the graph does not look smooth, 
as one would expect. The reason is that randomness was added when producing the 
graph to make it more realistic. In reality the variations from year to year are 
much larger. This equation which produces a sigmoid or S-shaped curve is called 
the <I>Logistic </I>equation. You can find more information about this in the 
<A HREF="facts_math.html">Facts about Population Growth Mathematical Models</A>

program does not use this exact mathematical model to represent the acorn yearly 
production. It uses instead a simplified version using only lines. This method

tales --</B> We now have a few interesting tales about acorns.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Acorn 
tale 1: Chances of making it</B> -- In a good year the oak tree will have many 
flowers -- up to several thousand. With the right humidity, the right temperature, 
no late frost in the spring, and sufficient rainfall in the summer, tiny scale-covered 
acorns (called nubbins at that point) begin to grow. They will mature to become 
full grown and ripe acorns by late summer. The chances of one acorn making it 
to become an oak tree are very slim -- less than 1/10,000. That means that for 
every 10,000 acorns, only one will become a tree!</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Acorn 
tale 2: Beetles destroying Acorns</B> -- Little insects called weevils like to 
plant their seeds inside acorns before they mature -- during the late summer months. 
Up to 90% of the acorns in a region can be destroyed by the <A HREF="javascript:dictionary.startIt('larvae')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" ONMOUSEOVER="dictionary.startIt ('larvae')"
ONMOUSEOUT="dictionary.clearIt ()">larvae</A> of the weevils. On the other hand, 
if there are not enough acorns, that can impact the weevils' population.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Acorn 
Tale 3: About hiding those Acorns</B> -- It is well known that squirrels hide 
acorns to last them through the winter season, when food is scarce. They might 
hide them in their homes, but they also bury them in the ground. In addition to 
squirrels, bluejays and woodpeckers also hide acorns underground. The number of 
acorns hidden by animals is pretty small; however, most of the acorns get hidden 
by the oak trees. When the oak trees shed their leaves during the autumn, they 
end up covering (and thus hiding) most of the acorns. It is interesting to know 
that many of the hidden acorns get rotten by mold and can not serve as food for 
the animals that hid them. In addition, many acorns are found by other animals, 
such as deer and wild turkeys, who benefit from them.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
        SRC="images/oakleave.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE" HSPACE="0"
        WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="135" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oak 
tree leave</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>What can destroy oak trees?</B> -- One common 
element that destroys oak trees is fire. When fire, caused by lightning or by 
a careless human being, hits a tree, the fire can spread and burn several trees. 
Another common destruction is caused by developments and the use of trees for 
wood.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">Another common cause of oak tree deaths is beetles, fungi, 
and bad weather. As I am finishing developing this lesson (Jun 2000)&nbsp;I&nbsp;heard 
on the radio the following amazing story. Oak trees in Marin&nbsp;County (which 
is north of San Francisco) are dying at a rate that has reached <I>epidemic</I> 
proportions, and scientists still don't know the cause of this<SUP><A HREF="#ref2">2</A>,<A HREF="#ref3">3</A></SUP>. 
Oaks, which typically take a year or so to die from infections, have been reported 
to die in just two to three weeks. Such massive die back of live oaks has never 
been reported in California, and a severe environmental crisis is expected in 
the months and years to come.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Balancing Tales -- </B>For 
a forest to grow and develop into such nice habitats, there needs to be an almost 
perfect balance between the different species that live in the forest. Here are 
a few examples where the intricate forest balance can be upset:</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Balancing 
tale 1: Can insects destroy trees? </B> -- Leaf-eating insects, such as walking 
sticks, can damage a tree. However, these insects are eaten many times by birds; 
thus balancing things.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Balancing tale 2: Can fungi destroy 
trees? </B> -- <A HREF="javascript:dictionary.startIt('fungi')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" ONMOUSEOVER="dictionary.startIt ('fungi')"
ONMOUSEOUT="dictionary.clearIt ()">Fungi</A> can invade the trunks and limbs of 
old trees with wounds. They soften and prepare the wood so that beetles, wasp 
larvae, and carpenter ants build tunnels, which further weakens the tree.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Balancing 
tale 3: Can caterpillars destroy trees? </B> -- Caterpillars, when they grow in 
big numbers, can <A HREF="javascript:dictionary.startIt('defoliate')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" ONMOUSEOVER="dictionary.startIt ('defoliate')"
ONMOUSEOUT="dictionary.clearIt ()">defoliate</A> an oak tree. However, there is 
a type of parasitic wasp that destroys the caterpillar moth's eggs. If there are 
enough wasps that eat a good number of the eggs, there will be less caterpillars, 
and the trees will be happy. Three or four defoliates can destroy a tree!</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Balancing 
tale 4: Can worms help trees? </B> -- A crucial and unsung hero is the earthworm. 
During warm rainy periods it stays above ground, but during the cold winter, it 
wriggles downward as far as it can to avoid freezing. It spends most of the winter 
one to four inches below the surface. In doing so it conditions the soil for shallow 
probing oak roots by literally eating his way around. This is very helpful, and 
many times necessary, for the tree growth.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Sizes</B> -- 
A trunk's circumference can be as big as 9 or more meters (32 feet), which corresponds 
to a trunk's diameter of 2.8 m (~ 9.5 ft). The height can reach up to 30 m (~ 
100 ft). The spread of the canopy of a full grown oak tree ranges from 25 to 40 
meters (85 to 135 feet) or more in diameter. </P><HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="50%"><P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>References</B>
