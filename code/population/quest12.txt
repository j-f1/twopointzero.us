QUESTION
What is the effect of varying the number of squirrels
and the time when they get introduced on the long-term
size of the population?
ANSWER
There is no difference. Are you surprised? Does it make
sense?  The long-term squirrel size population depends 
only on the available acorns.  The acorns act as the 
limiting factor and essentially determine the number of
squirrels that can be supported in the area or the 
carrying capacity.  One way to run the experiment is to
start with 30 trees and introduce two, four, 25, 50,
and 100 squirrels, all in year 30 and see what the 
long-term (year 120?) squirrel size population will be.
You can then introduce 10 squirrels in years 25, 50, 75,
and 100. Run the experiment and observe what the 
long-term stable population size will be. In all cases 
the squirrel population reaches a stable size of about 
82 squirrels.
