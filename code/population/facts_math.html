their corresponding specialties by studying and learning all they can about their

use the past and present knowledge as a stepping stone for the advancement of 
the state-of-the-art in their fields of interest.</P><P>The evolution of the mathematical 
models used to describe population growth and balance is a great example of how 
this field has evolved over the years. This page starts with a quick and simple 
description of this evolution and then presents <A HREF="#interesting">interesting 
and fascinating aspects</A> of some of them. Following that there is one more 
section with the detailed calculations of the <A HREF="#birthrate">Squirrels' 
Birth Rate</A> based on the population model.</P><P><B><FONT SIZE="4">1) Population 
Growth Mathematical Models</FONT></B></P><P><B><A NAME="unlimited"></A>Unlimited 
Growth</B>. The first mathematical model, referred to as the classical Malthusian 
scheme for population growth, is based on the work by Thomas R. Malthus (1766-1834). 
In <I>The Principle of Population</I> essay that he published in 1798, Malthus 
explained in fundamental and brilliantly simple terms his theories of human population 
growth and the connection between <A HREF="#note1">over-population and misery<SUP>1</SUP></A>. 
One of the fundamental concepts that he brought up is that of unlimited population 
growth.</P><P>The mathematical model based on this idea is that the population 
size for one generation depends on the size of the previous generation, and it 
is a multiple. This is expressed mathematically by the following equation:</P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="80%"><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/image42.gif" WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="24"></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">(1)</TD></TR></TABLE><P>where:</P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="93%"><TR><TD WIDTH="9%" VALIGN="TOP">t</TD><TD WIDTH="91%">represents

to as the Malthusian factor, is the multiple that determines the growth rate.</TD></TR></TABLE><P ALIGN="LEFT">This 
type of equation is called a <I>difference equation</I> because it allows you 
to find out the value of <I>p</I> at different <I>discrete</I> time intervals 
-- say at years 3, 4, 5, etc. You couldn’t use this to find out the size of <I>p</I> 
when <I>t = 3.578 </I><A HREF="#note2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>, because <I>t = 3.578</I> 
does not represent a <I>discrete</I> time.</P></DIV><P>The value <I>r</I> in the 
previous equation has a strong impact on how fast the population will grow. To 
help you understand how this works, get your calculator and try this simple formula. 
Start with an initial value for the population size (say <I>p<SUB>0</SUB></I> 
= 5) and one of <I>r</I> (say <I>r</I> = 3). Substitute the numbers to obtain 
<I>p<SUB>1 </SUB></I>, then <I>p<SUB>2 </SUB></I>, etc. Notice how quickly the 
population can grow. To help you visualize this, the following graph shows several 
population growths, all of which start with an initial population size of 2, i.e.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/image43.gif" WIDTH="45" HEIGHT="24"></P><P>and 
different values of <I>r</I>,</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="expgraph"></A><IMG
                SRC="images/math0.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0" WIDTH="345" HEIGHT="245"></P><P>As 
you can see, all the different curves have a similar shape. They are referred 
to as J-shaped curves. Graph the data from your own calculations. It should also 
produce a J-shaped curve. Notice that the difference in the value of <I>r</I> 
between the yellow and blue curves is only 0.02, but the population size is exactly 
double (4,000 vs. 2,000) after 40 time steps. The mathematical name for this type 
of growth is <B>exponential growth</B><A HREF="#note3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>.</P><P>This 
growth equation can be used in cases where there is truly this type of growth. 
For example, when a new species arrives to an island where there is plentiful 
of food, perfect conditions for reproduction, and no predators, or when a scientist 
starts growing bacteria under perfect conditions, one can certainly observe this 
(almost perfect) type of growth; although, not forever. That is why other mathematical 
models were developed.</P><P><B>Natural Equilibrium</B>. Robert H. McArthur and 
Edward O. Wilson helped found the field of <I>population biology </I>during the 
50’s and 60’s. Robert McArthur felt that mathematical models should be developed 
to describe the patterns that he found in nature instead of just providing simple 
textual descriptions. Their work started with the analysis of ant and bird population 
data. Through the analysis of a lot of experimental data they observed that the 
population size remained steady, even though the exact species varied. They were 
able to develop a very intricate mathematical model for this equilibrium that 
was published in 1962 (not presented here). Their conclusion after all their work 
with many different species and many different experiments was that:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P><I><CITE>Nature 
has this great tendency of balancing things out and reaching a very harmonious 
equilibrium. If nature were left alone, equilibrium would exist and populations 
would remain close to them.</CITE></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Limited growth</B>. 
The problem with the equation (1) model is that the population continues to grow 
unlimited over time. A major contribution came from Pierre Francois Verhulst, 
a scientist interested in population growth. Verhulst was born in 1804 in Brussels, 
Belgium. He showed in 1846 that the population growth not only depends on the 
population size but also on how far this size is from its upper limit. </P><P>Let's 
look at the mathematics behind this. Do you remember the definition of carrying 
capacity introduced in the <A HREF="popintro.html#carrying">fundamentals of population</A> 
section? Carrying capacity is the maximum population size that a given habitat 
can support. We’ll denote that as <I>K</I>. If the population is far below <I>K</I>, 
it would tend to grow rapidly, but as it approaches <I>K,</I> the growth would 
slow down. If the population size would exceed its upper limit <I>K,</I> the growth 
would actually be negative!<A HREF="#note4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>. &nbsp;In order to 
model this, Verhulst modified equation (1) to make the population size proportional 
to both the previous population and a new term:</P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="80%"><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT SIZE="2"><IMG SRC="images/image44.gif" WIDTH="62" HEIGHT="42"></FONT></I></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">(2)</TD></TR></TABLE><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P><P>This 
term reflects how far the population is from its maximum limit. Let's assume that 
the carrying capacity <I>K</I> is 2000. If the population is just starting with 
a small value (say 50 or less), then this new term will be very close to one. 
However, as the population value grows and gets closer to <I>K</I>, this new term 
will become very small and get to zero or even negative, providing the right feedback 
to limit the population growth. The following table shows values for this term 
for different values of <I>p<SUB>t</SUB></I> when <I>K</I> is 2000:</P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE BORDER="BORDER" CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH=41%>

0.005 </TD></TR> </TABLE><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"></DIV></DIV><P>So the equation using 
this new term and named after Verhulst is:</P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="80%"><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><I><FONT SIZE="2"><IMG SRC="images/image45.gif" WIDTH="118" HEIGHT="26"></FONT></I></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">(3)</TD></TR></TABLE><P><A NAME="sigmoid"></A>This 
equation is also known as a <I>logistic difference equation</I>. Comparing it 
with equation (1) it is nonlinear in the sense that one can’t simply multiply 
the previous population by a factor. In this case the population <I>p<SUB>t</SUB></I> 
on the right of the equation is being multiplied by itself. One of the nice things 
about this equation is that it is relatively easy to solve and it is also easy 
to see how it behaves by looking at a chart produced by it. The following chart 
was produced with <I>K</I> = 1000, <I>r</I> = 1.3, and an initial value <I>p<SUB>0</SUB></I> 
of 0.1:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="sgraph"></A><IMG
                SRC="images/math1.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></P><P>The 
curve produced by the logistic equation resembles an S. That is why it is called 
an S-shaped curve or a Sigmoid. As you can see, when the population starts to 
grow, it does go through an exponential growth phase, but as it gets closer to 
the carrying capacity (approximately when the time step reaches 37), the growth 
slows down and it reaches a stable level. There are many examples in nature that 
show that when the environment is stable the maximum number of individuals in 
a population fluctuates near the carrying capacity of the environment. However, 
if the environment becomes unstable, the population size can have dramatic changes.</P><P>The 
logistic growth equation is a useful model for demonstrating the effects of density-dependent 
mechanisms in population growth. However, its utility in real populations is limited 
because the dynamics of populations are complex and because it is difficult to 
come up with the real value for <I>K</I> in a given habitat. In addition, <I>K</I> 
is not a fixed number over time; it is always changing depending on many conditions. 
In the following sections we’ll briefly describe other factors and models to better 
model population growth.</P><P><B>Age Structure Dependencies</B>. Up until now 
we assumed that the size of the population in the next time period depends, using 
one factor, on the whole size of the current population. It does not take into 
account the fact that not all members of the population will reproduce and that 
reproduction depends on the individuals age. In essence it uses a simplistic probability 
average. Equation (1) could be expressed as a function as follows:</P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="80%"><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/image46.gif" WIDTH="85" HEIGHT="24"></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">(4)</TD></TR></TABLE><P>Equation 
(4) simply says that the population for the next time period is a function (or 
depends) on the present population. To take into account the age structure dependencies, 
equation (4) becomes:</P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="80%"><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/image47.gif" WIDTH="185" HEIGHT="24"></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">(5)</TD></TR></TABLE><P>This 
means that the population is now a function of the current population, the population 
the year before, the year before that, etc. Please note that <I>f</I> implies 
a generic function and it is different in equation (4) and (5). Also, the function 
for each of the previous populations could be very different. Equation (5) can 
become very complicated and difficult to solve!</P><P><B>Competition</B>. One 
other aspect that we have not taken into account in the previous equations is 
that of competing species. Of course, one could say that the r factor takes that 
into account, and it does, but it is difficult to accurately model real populations 
that way. </P><P>Lets assume that there are two species competing for the same 
resource and that we can use the logistic equation to model their independent 
growth. We can essentially use the same equation (3) for each of the two populations 
<I>p</I> and <I>q</I> after adding a new term to get:</P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="80%"><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/image48.gif" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="29"></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">(6)</TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="80%"><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/image49.gif" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="29"></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">(7)</TD></TR></TABLE><P>The 
sub-indexes 1 and 2 are used to indicate that <I>r<SUB>1 </SUB></I>, <I>K<SUB>1 
</SUB></I>, and <I>c<SUB>1</SUB></I> are different from <I>r<SUB>2 </SUB></I>, 
<I>K<SUB>2 </SUB></I>, and <I>c<SUB>2 </SUB></I>, each set reflecting the characteristics 
of <I>p</I> and <I>q</I> respectively. The new term in equation (6) <I>c<SUB>1 
</SUB>q<SUB>t</SUB></I> (and equivalently in equation (7) <I>c<SUB>2 </SUB>p<SUB>t 
</SUB></I>) is the one that takes care of the competition factor. As the population 
of the other species increases, this new term increases, and as it is subtracting, 
it slows down the growth of <I>p</I>. One could say that the carrying capacity 
under this scenario depends on the other population and becomes <I>K<SUB>1</SUB> 
– c<SUB>1 </SUB>q<SUB>t</SUB></I>. A very interesting thing is that this carrying 
capacity in this set of coupled equations becomes dynamic. Instead of being a 
constant, it is a value that changes over time. Something else to notice is that 
if both <I>c</I>’s are zero, then equations (6) and (7) have the exact form as 
equation (3).</P><P><B>A predator and prey model</B>. Trying to take into account 
two populations where one is the prey and the other the predator is similar to 
the previous case. The difference is that the species are at different <A HREF="facts_foodchain.html#trophic">trophic</A> 
levels. As there are more predators, the prey population starts decreasing. On 
the other hand, as the number of prey increases, the predator population benefits 
and increases as well. The equations to model this behavior look like this:</P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="80%"><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="2"><IMG SRC="images/image50.gif" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="32"></FONT></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">(8)</TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="80%"><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD><TD ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="2"><IMG SRC="images/image51.gif" WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="36"></FONT></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT">(9)</TD></TR></TABLE><P>These 
equations were discovered independently by the American Alfred Lotka (in 1925) 
and the Italian Vito Volterra (in 1926) and are known as the Lotka-Volterra equations. 
You will notice that essentially the prey population <I>p</I> increases, just 
as before, based on the term:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/image52.gif" WIDTH="78" HEIGHT="28"></P><P ALIGN="LEFT">but 
is destroyed dependent on the term:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/image53.gif" WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="24"></P><P>Similarly, 
the predator population <I>q</I> decreases based on the term:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/image54.gif" WIDTH="93" HEIGHT="36"></P><P>but 
increases based on the term:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="2"><IMG SRC="images/image55.gif" WIDTH="70" HEIGHT="24"></FONT></P><P>It 
is interesting to note that the last two terms on both equations (8) and (9) are 
dependent on both the prey and predator populations. The Lotka-Volterra equations 
have evolved and there are many different versions of equations based on the concepts 
introduced 75 years ago.</P><P>In conclusion, several different concepts and models 
were described in the previous paragraphs, but each of them separate. A real and 
accurate population model would need to consider most of them at the same time. 
Imagine an ecosystem where one is trying to model many interdependent species, 
and it is easy to see how the mathematical models can get quite complicated.</P><P><B><FONT SIZE="4"><A NAME="interesting"></A>2) 
Interesting and complex aspects of the basic logistic equation</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="4">.</FONT> 
</P><P>We will now describe and show some very interesting aspects of the <I>logistic 
difference equation, </I>equation (3). Most of this work was collected for the 
first time by Robert May in a classic article published in Nature in June of 1976. 
Robert May started his career as a physicist but then did his post-doctoral work 
in applied mathematics. He became very interested in the mathematical explanations 
of what enables competing species to coexist and then in the mathematics behind 
populations growth. </P><P>When people started working with this equation they 
noticed an interesting behavior depending on the value of <I>r</I>. We will illustrate 
their findings with graphs produced by running the equation with different values 
of <I>r</I> starting with <I>r</I> = 0. Unless mentioned otherwise, will use a 
value of <I>K</I> = 1000 in the following graphs.</P><P> <B>Decline to Zero</B>. 
When the value of <I>r</I> if between 0 and 1, the population will eventually 
decrease to zero. This is illustrated in the following graph where we used an 
initial population of 500 individuals or <I>p<SUB>0</SUB></I> = 500:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
                SRC="images/math2.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></P><P>As 
you can see, the population of 500 will decrease to zero. Increasing the value 
of <I>r</I> towards the value of one slows down the decline, but nevertheless 
the population goes to zero.</P><P><B>Normal Population Growth.</B> When the value 
of <I>r</I> is between 1 and 3, the population will increase following the sigmoid 
curve towards a stable value. Here is the graph that illustrates this:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
                SRC="images/math3.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></P><P>In 
this case the initial population is <I>P<SUB>0</SUB></I> = 0.01 and the three 
cases show very different speeds towards achieving their stable values. Their 
stable values also differ considerably between 200, 500 and 636.3636. One more 
thing to notice is that when the value of <I>r</I> is larger than 2.4, the equation 
shows an oscillation which is larger as it gets closer to 3.0, but in all cases 
the oscillation dies down and the population value settles down to its steady 
value.</P><P>One very interesting aspect of the logistic equation is that the 
long-term value<A HREF="#note5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> of the population will be the 
same regardless of where it starts. This is shown in the next graph where we have 
repeated the same setup as used for the previous graph except for the starting 
population values. As you can see, with very different <I>p(0)</I>'s the long 
term stable values are exactly the same, 200, 500 and 636.3636. Here is the chart:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
                SRC="images/math4.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></P><P><B>Multiple 
stable values.</B> When the value of <I>r</I> reaches the <I>magic</I> value of 
3, something strange happens. The population does not reach one steady value. 
It gets to a point where it oscillates between two steady values! This means that 
the population does very well one season and increases in size dramatically. The 
following season there is overpopulation scrambling for the same resources and 
many die decreasing the size. The population size goes up and down between two 
values. </P><P>As we continue increasing the value of <I>r</I>, we reach a point 
when <I>r</I> is 3.4495 where instead of the population switching on and off between 
two values, it switches between four values! This effect can be seen several more 
times when the oscillation happens between eight values (when <I>r</I> = 3.56), 
sixteen values (when <I>r</I> = 3.596), etc. The following charts shows three 
graphs of this behavior:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
                SRC="images/math5.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
                SRC="images/math6.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0" WIDTH="419" HEIGHT="266"></P><P>One 
might think that the last chart is really oscillating randomly, but it is jumping 
up and down between 8 values. Will this continue as we increase the values of 
<I>r</I>? &nbsp;Lets see the next section.</P><P> <B>Chaos.</B> As we continue 
to increase the value of <I>r</I> we reach another <I>magic</I> point, when <I>r 
</I>reaches a value of 3.7. At that point it looks like the population jumps in 
a very random and unpredictable way, and it behaves this way until it reaches 
a value 4.0. This behavior that looks very much like random, but really isn't, 
is called <B>chaos</B><A HREF="#note6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>. Look at the following 
graph where we used a value of <I>r</I> = 3.725:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG

though there seems to be some pattern, if you look closely, it is really not repeating 
the values from one period to the next. Isn’t it amazing that such a simple formula, 
which was working in a simple way, describes so many different behaviors reaching 
all the way to the complexities of chaos? Even though the changes from period 
to period seem absolutely random, there is clearly some regularity to the oscillations.</P><P>The 
deterministic logistic equation, meaning an equation which can predict the same 
values over time, produces what looks like random behavior. The last aspect to 
notice regarding this chaotic phenomena is how sensitive the behavior is to the 
values of <I>r</I>. It behaves so differently by simply varying the values between 
0 and 4.0 and <I>very small changes can produce quite different results!</I></P><P><B>Boom-and-Bust 
Curve</B>. Some populations go through periods where their sizes suddenly increase 
dramatically for a few generations and then go back to their normal stable numbers. 
Insects are a common species that go through a tremendous growth for a few weeks, 
followed by a sudden collapse. Some species can increase their number even more 
than a thousand times. As you can see in the next graph, the growth starts exponentially 
but is quickly followed by a sudden collapse.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG

An example of this behavior is a pest in the Swiss&nbsp;Alps known as the larch 
bud moth which goes through 8 or 9 year cycles during which its numbers multiply 
up to 100,000 times!<A HREF="#note7"><SUP>7</SUP></A></P><P><FONT SIZE="4"><B>3) 
Complexity of the mathematical models</B></FONT></P><P>By now you probably got 
the idea that the mathematical models of population growth, when incorporating 
many of the issues described in the previous sections, can become quite complex, 
especially as the models need to map to real physical characteristics of the natural 
world. Just imagine a predator that switches prey from time to time. It can be 
very challenging but when one finds a mathematical model that works, it is <I>very 
rewarding!</I> Here follows an interesting example.</P><P>Maria J. Milicich, an 
Ecologist, has studied a very colorful fish found in the Great Barrier Reef in 
Australia known as damselfish<A HREF="#note8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>. These damselfish 
lay their eggs at the reef's bottom. The full moon causes the larvae to hatch 
and come out about once a month. The larvae leave the reef and about 20 days later 
return as mature larvae. Milicich was working with data consisting of eggs released 
from nests, number of larvae that hatched, and the number of mature larvae that 
return to the reef.</P><P>In looking specifically at the data for the mature larvae, 
Milicich expected the numbers to be close to an equilibrium point; however, she 
found that the numbers varied dramatically. Some months she found only a few larvae 
and in others she found thousands of them! The feeling was that these fluctuations 
were random and attributed to weather changes, unknown diseases, sampling errors, 
or what is referred to as environmental noise (unknown causes in the environment).</P><P>Milicich 
used linear models, which did not work very well, so decided to model the numbers 
of mature larvae using a non-linear model. Her approach was to compare the linear 
and the non-linear models to see which one predicted the numbers more accurately. 
She and her team<A HREF="#note8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> played with hundreds and hundreds 
of environment variables to try to improve the predictability of the non-linear 
model. They finally came up with a model that took into account: (a) the moon's 
phase, (b) the water turbulence around the reef, and (c) the wind speed. This 
non-linear model proved to be significantly better than the previous linear model. 
Not only that, but these three physical variables made perfect ecological sense. 
They were able to better understand the roles that the moon, water turbulence 
and wind have on the overall damselfish population process. When the three combine 
positively, the larvae reach maturity in great numbers, but when they work against 
each other, their numbers are very small.</P><P><B><FONT SIZE="4"><A NAME="birthrate"></A>4) 
Calculation of the Squirrels Birth Rate</FONT></B></P><P>If you run an experiment 
several times to observe the squirrel’s population growth, you might notice that 
the growth is not always the same. The reason is that there is some variability. 
Squirrels will not always have the exact same number of offspring, and some might 
die because of some other causes. The model attempts to model this behavior. By 
setting up the model with 60 trees and introducing two squirrels in year 75, the 
results of five consecutive runs were:</P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE BORDER="BORDER" CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH=80%>

it several times is equivalent to making observations in different locations, 
under different conditions, in different periods of times, etc. It makes the results 
more general and valid. That means that the results are not only valid for a specific 
group of squirrels in a specific location. The conclusions or results can be then 
applied to squirrels in general.</P><P>The average squirrel population in year 
79 after five runs is 77.4 squirrels. This is the number that will be used in 
this example. Now, let's try to come up with the mathematical growth model. Let's 
assume that <I>n</I><SUB>i</SUB> represents the number of squirrels on year I 
and <I>f</I> represents the birth rate. Then <I>n</I><SUB>1 </SUB>represents the 
number of squirrels in year one and <I>n</I><SUB>2</SUB> represents the number 
of squirrels in year two (or the following year). <I>n</I><SUB>2 </SUB>can then 
be expressed as:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="2"><IMG SRC="images/image30.gif" WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="41"></FONT></P><P>Let's 
see what this formula represents. The term <I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB>/2 represents the 
number of couples (if there are 6 squirrels it is assumed that there are 3 couples). 
Multiplying the number of couples by <I>f</I> (the birth rate) will give the number 
of squirrels that will be born. Adding this to the current population (<I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB>) 
gives you the expected population on the following year. Now lets write the equivalent 
equation for <I>n</I><SUB>3</SUB>:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="2"><IMG SRC="images/image31.gif" WIDTH="176" HEIGHT="41"></FONT></P><P>and

we'll substitute the values that we know on this last equation. From the table 
we know that <I>n</I><SUB>5</SUB> is 77.4 and <I>n</I><SUB>1</SUB> is equal to 
2, so the last equation will become:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="2"><IMG SRC="images/image36.gif" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="41"></FONT></P><P>Solving

giving us the final answer of:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="+1">Birth Rate 
of 3</FONT></P><P>As was indicated at the beginning of this section, when you 
do multiple relevant experiments combining the data in a logical way and following 
a formal mathematical method to find out the result, the answer is more accurate
