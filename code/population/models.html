section we describe in simple terms what mathematical and computer models are. 
These models are the basis for the program or computer model that you'll be using 
in the last sections of the lesson. Models are also basic tools used by Population 
Ecologists in the study and analysis of populations.</P><P><B>Mathematical models</B>. 
Scientists have always tried to come up with models that will behave, as close 
as possible, to the actual problem that they are trying to understand and analyze. 
When these models can accurately describe a system's behavior, in addition to 
helping provide an explanation of how the system works, they can also be used 
to predict how the system will work under different conditions. Before there were 
computers the models developed by scientists were entirely mathematical. Some 
models use pretty simple equations, while others can be very complex. </P><P>To 
better understand what is meant by a mathematical model, let's do a simple example. 
Let's assume that the problem that we are trying to analyze and understand is 
that of the growth of a squirrel population. Assume that there is a special cabin 
in the woods that you visit once a year and that squirrels live around the cabin. 
Let's also assume that since you've always been fascinated with the squirrels, 
every year you visit this nice cabin you count the total number of squirrels and 
keep good notes in your yearly visits diary. After several years, you go over 
the data that you collected and you pose yourself a problem by asking, &quot;How 
quickly does the squirrel population grow? How many squirrels will I find this 
coming summer when I go back to the cabin?&quot; In order to try to answer these 
questions you first look at the data that you've collected over the last five 
years: </P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="3"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="88"><FONT SIZE="+1">Year</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="132"><FONT SIZE="+1">Number

observing the data and looking for a pattern, you suddenly realize that the squirrel 
population is doubling every year, i.e. the population of any given year is twice 
that of the previous year. The thing to do at this point is to write this mathematically, 
that is, with a formula or equation. In order to do this we need to use variables 
to represent the different quantities. The following table shows the variables 
that we will use:</P></DIV></DIV><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE BORDER="2" CELLPADDING="3" WIDTH="80%"><TR VALIGN="BOTTOM"><TD ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="61" VALIGN="BOTTOM">Variable</TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="91" VALIGN="TOP">What

the population on a specific year such as 1998, one can write p(1998) = 40 squirrels</TD></TR></TABLE><P ALIGN="LEFT">Once 
the concepts introduced with the previous table are well understood, it is very

previous section is a very simple one; however, some models can be very complex. 
In those cases a computer model can be very helpful in implementing the mathematical 
model. A computer model is essentially a computer program that contains the mathematical 
model and uses it to calculate solutions to given problems. In the early days 
of computers, the computer models or programs would read in a set of numbers, 
do their calculations, and print out the results. The computers of today are much 
more powerful and can do much more. A computer model can display the results graphically 
as it does the calculations, and it can also take the input through a nice user 
interface (by pointing and clicking with the mouse). These are advantages, but 
a more important advantage is that they can handle more complex mathematical models 
that better reflect the reality of the system being modeled.</P><P>Computer models 
can be developed for many different systems. A few examples are: </P><UL><LI>Car 
traffic patterns on a given freeway </LI><LI>Weather prediction </LI><LI>Operation 
of a fast food restaurant </LI><LI>Population growth and balance</LI></UL><P>Since 
we are dealing with a population growth model in this lesson, from here on that 
is the system that we will be describing; however, remember that many of the concepts 
apply to other systems.</P><P>There are three general ways to develop computer 
models:</P><OL><LI>By taking known nature rules and using them to develop the 
model. For example, if it is known that a certain species has 5 to 7 offspring 
every year and that it eats 50 pounds of food every month, one would use those 
numbers in the model.</LI><LI>By analyzing and sampling nature, doing tables and 
charts, coming up with mathematical equations that can produce the charts as accurately 
as possible, and then using those equations in the model.</LI><LI>A combination 
of both.</LI></OL><P><B>Why use computer models?</B> There are many advantages 
to using computer models. Here are some of the most important ones. If you can 
think of others, let me know and I might include them here.</P><OL><LI>To gain 
a good understanding of the system being modeled -- In order to come up with an 
accurate model, one needs to understand how the real physical system behaves. 
Many times one needs to do many observations, collect data, graph data, come up 
with a first attempt to describe the model (that is, write an initial formula 
or mathematical model), do more observations, compare the initial model against 
the observations, improve the model, etc. etc. One needs to get very involved 
into understanding the real system's behavior in order to develop a good model.</LI><LI>To 
discover special behaviors of the system -- In general terms, models don't reflect 
the physical system 100%. One could say that there is always room for improvement. 
Here is a typical example. There are many cases where you have your real system 
and a model of it, and they are not identical. You do tons of observations and 
measurements on the real system followed by comparisons against the computer model 
to find out that they correlate (match or agree) most of the time. However, there 
might be a few places or conditions under which they disagree. These might be 
very interesting, surprising, and challenging situations. To be able to explain 
the differences one might have to do more and different kinds of observations, 
lots of analysis, lots of study, lots of exchange of information with other scientists, 
etc., to be able to come up with a reasonable explanation. Once there is a sensible 
explanation, one that several people agree with, the model can be refined or improved 
to reflect this new condition. The model will now reflect the realities of the 
physical system more accurately. The important aspect here is that scientists 
might think that they have a reasonable understanding of the physical system. 
After going through the whole exercise to refine the model, what they are really 
doing is discovering new mechanisms or behaviors of the system as well as coming 
up with explanations for these.</LI><LI>To predict behavior under different conditions 
-- A common use of models is to use them to attempt to predict what the system 
will do if some of the conditions change. For example, when dealing with a population 
model of several species, one may want to try to figure out what would happen 
if, say:<BR><BR><UL><LI>one of the species grows faster or slower than normal, 
or</LI><LI>the reproduction rate changes for one of the species, or</LI><LI>one 
of the primary food supplies decreases, or</LI><LI>a new predator comes to the 
area, etc. </LI></UL></LI><P>If the model can handle these changes and accurately 
predict what would happen under any of these new conditions, it can be very helpful 
to scientists.</P><LI> Last but not least, to learn about the physical system 
-- A computer model can also be very useful for people to interact with it and 
gain a good understanding of the behavior of the physical system. This is essentially 
the objective of this lesson, for you <I><B>to interact and control a population 
growth and balance computer model to learn and appreciate how species interact 
and depend on each other</B></I>. The next section describes the model that will 
be used in the rest of this lesson.</LI></OL><P>&nbsp;</P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="80%" CELLPADDING="5"><TR ALIGN="CENTER"><TD WIDTH="31%" ALIGN="LEFT"><P><A HREF="popintro.html"><IMG
