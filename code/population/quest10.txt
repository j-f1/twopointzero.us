QUESTION
Can you come up with the mathematical equation that
relates the yearly acorn production A to the age of the
Oak tree Y in years?  Make sure that you cover years 0
through 200.
ANSWER
The equation for the portion of time when the production
is increasing, that is, between the years 23 and 117
is A = -483 + 23Y.  The complete and formal solution
covering the complete year range is:

        A = 0                   when Y < 22
        A = -483 + 23Y     when 22 <= Y <= 116
        A = 2200              when Y > 116
END
