QUESTION
How many acorns are needed per year per squirrel?
ANSWER
Look at the previous experiment with 30 oak trees.
After many years the yearly production reaches
66,000 acorns and a squirrel population of about 80.
If we divide the number of acorns into 80 we get about
825 per squirrel each year.  In the model, it takes 
about 57 years for a young seedling to produce about 
825 acorns!
END
