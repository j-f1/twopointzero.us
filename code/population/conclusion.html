--</B></P><P>A computer model was used to learn and understand the relationship 
among two interdependent populations. Different population growth curves were 
observed as well as different scenarios of how the populations evolved over time. 
In some cases the populations were able to survive in harmony for many years. 
</P><P>Mathematical equations were also developed to describe mathematically some 
of the population growth curves. Many interesting facts about oak trees, gray 
squirrels, and red-tail hawks were presented to gain knowledge about the different 
species. </P><P>Finally, I hope that after going through this lesson, you've developed 
or improved your sense of respect towards the environment and conservation of 
our natural world and all the living organisms.</P><P><B>Acknowledgments --</B></P><P>I 
would like to thank Sally Waterhouse, an adjunct professor of Zoology at Ohio 
Wesleyan University, for suggesting to use the system consisting of oak trees, 
squirrels, and red-tailed hawks.</P><P>I would also like to thank Tom Carrolan 
for providing very good insight into hawks' behavior as it relates to squirrels.
