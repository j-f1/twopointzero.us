QUESTION
What is the squirrels' birth rate?
ANSWER
One simple way to set this up is to introduce two
squirrels when there is plenty of food so that they can
increase in numbers without restrictions. One way to do
that is to have 60 trees and wait until year 75 or more
to introduce the two squirrels.  Doing exactly this, one
can see the following population growth in the table:

        YEAR        SQUIRRELS
        ------         ----------------
         75                  2
         76                  5
         77                 12
         78                 29
         79                 71

In analyzing the data in the table, the two squirrels in
the year 75 have three offspring and the population 
grows to five.  In year 76 there are 2 couples, if each
has three offspring, the population would grow to 
5 + 6 = 11.  The table shows 12.  In year 77 there are 
6 couples, again, if each couple has three offspring, 
the population would increase to 12 + (3 x 6) = 30.  
The table shows 29.  Based on these results one can 
conclude that the squirrels' birth rate is 3.

NOTE:  The answer to this question could have been 
figured out by simply looking at the setup in the model 
where the default squirrels birth rate is set to 3.
