survival. Similarly, it assumes that the hawks depend on a minimal amount of squirrels

can see how both the number of acorns and the number of squirrels grow and stabilize 
in very similar ways. Does this make sense? Yes it does. You can see very clearly 
how the supply of food (the acorns) is directly tied to the number of squirrels 
(the consumer). If the number of acorns would go up and down over the years, so 
would the number of squirrels. One final comment. Even though in all the different 
experiments the final number of squirrels stabilized at the same level, what was 
different among the experiments? Think about that.</P><P><A NAME="exp5"></A><IMG

have to wait much longer before the tree becomes full grown and yearly production

measure of squirrels' life expectancy, you would need to study large populations 
of squirrels in the wild for many years. Some squirrels die younger and some older. 
After observing many squirrels go through their life cycle, you would analyze 
the data and obtain some type of average. The number used in the model is based 
on such studies and analysis. You can now see a nice advantage of a model such 
as this. In a mater of minutes you can figure out the answer.</P><P><IMG
