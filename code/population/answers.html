stable level.</I><BR><BR></LI><LI>Provide four different examples of population 
growth limiting factors.<BR><BR><I><IMG

a predator and prey populations live in a stable phase where their population 
sizes don't change much from year to year. Suddenly one year there are drastic 
changes in their sizes. Can you give three examples of factors or situations that 
can cause this?<BR><BR><I><IMG
                SRC="images/arrow.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"> (1) A health 
problem that affects the prey population reducing their size, (2) A very good 
year for the producers that provide more food than normal for the prey population 
allowing them to increase their numbers, and (3) A new prey population immigrates 
to the area and the predator now has more choices, so the original prey population 
increases in numbers.<BR><BR></I></LI><LI>If you run the model with a combination 
that produces a stable population balance for both squirrels and hawks, you might 
have noticed that the stable squirrels' population under that situation is smaller 
than the stable squirrel population when there are no hawks. Can you explain why?<BR><BR><I><IMG
                SRC="images/arrow.gif" WIDTH="19"
                HEIGHT="13" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"> The reason is that 
when there are hawks, there are two limiting factors. One can see the effect of 
the predator on the prey.</I><BR><BR> </LI><LI>What formula would you use to determine

density can be calculated as the number of individuals in a population divided 
by the size of the specific area where they live. In case of a population living 
in water, one would divide the number of individuals by the volume of water where 
they live.</I><BR><BR></LI><LI>What are the differences between <I><B>density-dependent</B></I>

of density-dependent factors depends on the number of organisms in the population 
whereas the impact of density-independent factors does not depend on the number 
of organisms in the population.</I><BR><BR></LI><LI>Are predators a density-dependent 
or density-independent limiting factor for a population growth?<BR><BR><I><IMG

                HEIGHT="13" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"> </I><I>It is a density-dependent 
factor. How much prey will be consumed by the predator is very dependent on both 
the number of prey and predators.</I><BR><BR></LI><LI>How can one calculate the 
carrying capacity of a given species in an ecosystem?<BR><BR><I><IMG

                HEIGHT="13" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"> </I><I>One way would 
be an empirical one; that is, one based on actual data collection. One could look 
at that species population growth curve and determine the number of individuals 
once the growth levels off and reaches a stable balance. That point of the curve 
is the carrying capacity and takes into account all the factors that help population 
growth as well as the ones that limit it.</I><BR><I><BR>Another way is based on 
theoretical analysis where one would calculate and predict how many individuals 
could be supported by the environmental resources in the ecosystem. One would 
also have to take into account the limiting factors (such as predators) on the 
population.</I><BR><BR></LI><LI>You may have noticed that in the population charts 
used by the program, the maximum value (or carrying capacity) for all the different 
organisms is known. How can this be?<BR><BR><I><IMG

does the theoretical analysis predicting this maximum value based on all the conditions 
selected to run the model.</I><BR><BR></LI><LI>Let's assume that there is a stable 
food chain and that suddenly the number of primary consumer individuals goes down 
to half. What would you expect would happen to the producer and to the secondary 
consumer?<BR><BR><I><IMG

                HEIGHT="13" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"> </I><I>The number 
of producer organisms would increase as there would be less demand for them, and 
the number of consumers would decrease as competition among them for the same 
resource would increase.</I><BR><BR></LI><LI>In a marsh ecosystem there are grasshoppers 
which are herbivores and frogs which feed on the grasshoppers. Which of the two 
populations do you expect to have more individuals and why?<BR><BR><I><IMG

                HEIGHT="13" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"> </I><I>Based on the 
concept of the ecological pyramid, the bio-energy at the trophic level of the 
grasshoppers should be about 10 times larger than that at the level of the frogs 
and since the grasshoppers are smaller than the frogs, then the quantity of grasshoppers 
should be much larger than that of frogs.</I><BR><BR></LI><LI>Based on the model 
used in this lesson, how many squirrels and how many hawks can a single oak tree 
sustain?<BR><BR><I><IMG

                HEIGHT="13" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"> </I><I>A single oak 
tree can sustain somewhere between two and three squirrels. The model assumes 
that each hawk needs three squirrels per year. Therefore, one oak tree (in the 
model) can barely sustain one hawk. How does this compare with the 10% energy 
rule of the ecological pyramid?</I><BR><BR></LI><LI>Describe what a <I><B>food
