-- </P><P><B>The main purpose of this lesson</B> is to learn about population 
growth and balance. However, in presenting this topic other very interesting and 
relevant topics will also be covered, giving a broad picture of issues related 
to the study of population growth. The main topics that you'll be learning about 
are: </P><UL><LI><B>Population Balance</B> - You'll be using an actual computer 
model, implemented as a Java applet<SUP><A HREF="#note1">1</A></SUP>, to do hands-on 
control of an ecosystem, </LI><LI><B>Mathematical and Computer Models</B> - The 
importance of both mathematical and computer models in the study of population 
growth will be described and analyzed to gain a good understanding of the tools 
used by Population Ecologists, </LI><LI><B>Facts About the Populations</B> - In 
order to understand the interaction between different populations, interesting 
facts about them will be discovered and learned, </LI><LI><B>Nature Conservation</B> 
- One of the goals of this lesson is, as you become more aware of the delicate 
balance of ecosystems and population growths, you'll become a strong supporter 
of nature and the environment. </LI></UL><P><B>The system</B> that we will be 
working with is an <B>oak tree</B> forest where <B>gray squirrels</B> live together 
with <B>red-tail hawks</B>. The gray squirrels live off of the acorns produced 
by the oak trees, and the red-tail hawks' subsistence depends on the squirrels 
on which they prey. Here are a few pictures of the elements that you will be working 
with:</P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="10" WIDTH="22%"

</LI><LI><B>Experiments</B> - You will then design an experiment to test your 
theory and will use the computer model to verify it </LI><LI><B>Theory</B> - After 
running the experiment several times and proving the hypothesis, you'll be able

lesson starts by describing the basic concepts of populations and ecosystems and 
then describes mathematical and computer models as background information. These 
topics are important to allow you to better understand the rest of the lesson. 
Next, the actual population model used in the last three sections is described 
followed by the specific instructions on how to use it. The three sections that 
follow are the actual hands-on sections where you will work on 10 experiments 
using the Java population model. The lesson concludes with a quiz that you should 
do as a self-assessment of your understanding of the concepts that are presented 
in this lesson.</P><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">A few technicalities before we get started</FONT></B> 
--</P><OL><LI>One of the objectives of this lesson is to present many concepts 
as close to the real facts as possible. However, some issues will be presented 
which are not 100% accurate. Every effort has been made to point out those issues. 
</LI><LI>Special pages with many facts and definitions can be accessed to find 
out information or clarifications. You'll have to access these to be able to answer 
some of the questions throughout the lesson. </LI><LI>Throughout the lesson you 
will see words that are <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('blue')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('blue')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">blue</a>. Putting the cursor over those words 
will bring up a small window with the description or meaning of the word. Older 
web browsers might show the words as normal links, that is, blue and <a href="javascript:dictionary.startIt('underline')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" onMouseOver="dictionary.startIt ('underline')"
onMouseOut="dictionary.clearIt ()">underlined</a>, but they work the same. Let 
me know if any word should be added to this on-line dictionary. </LI><LI><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="78%" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD HEIGHT="35" WIDTH="84%">The
