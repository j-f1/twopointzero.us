purpose of this letter is to give you a few tips and suggestions to make sure 
that you have a good experience going through the lesson.</P><P>The lesson is 
not short, as it covers a broad area of subjects and tries to cover as many relevant 
topics as possible. The use of the actual Population applet or program doesn't 
start until about the middle of the lesson because it is important that you understand 
all the basics and how to use the program before you use it. Once you start using 
the program, you'll work on 10 different experiments, some of them pretty easy 
to allow you to learn the use of the program. <I>Be patient,</I> as it is certainly 
worth it to go through the entire lesson. The lesson gets better as you move forward.</P><P>Now 
a few specific tips:</P><OL><LI>It is important to remember that the program does 
not work exactly as the real ecosystem does. There are some simplifications that 
are described in the facts pages in paragraphs that start with arrows like this: 
&nbsp;<IMG SRC="images/arrow.gif" ALIGN="ABSBOTTOM" WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="13"></LI><LI>When 
running the experiments you can look at the image of the trees and how they grow. 
You can then look at the tiny squirrels and the hawks. But as a scientist you 
really want to look at the numbers in the table and the shapes of the curves in 
the chart to start analyzing what is happening (or not happening)&nbsp;with the 
different populations.</LI><LI>While running the experiments you can open and 
close both the table and the chart as many times as you want. Remember that you 
have this flexibility.</LI><LI>Something else to be aware of (and this is explained 
in the <A HREF="instructions.html#graphs" TARGET="">instructions</A>) is that 
the Y-axis scale changes based on how you setup the experiment. For example, 100% 
of acorns might represent 25,000 or only 500 acorns. Don't be confused if the 
curves of two different experiments look almost the same as they might represent 
completely different values. Always check the table and the maximum values in 
the chart.</LI><LI>Be patient when loading or starting the program as it might 
take a while to load all it needs. Depending on your connection to the internet 
it might take anywhere from 10 seconds to about a minute.</LI><LI>Lastly, when 
doing the experiments, you may want to repeat them several times without changing 
the setups. Like with real nature, the model does not always produce the same 
results.</LI></OL><P>Your <A HREF="../mailform.html">feedback</A> is very important 
to make sure that things work and make sense with this lesson. By providing feedback 
you might be helping other students, as I might incorporate into the lessons some 
of the feedback that I receive.</P><P>I do hope that you will enjoy this lesson 
while learning lots of new concepts and that you'll gain a deeper appreciation 
of the scientific world as well as the environment.</P><P>Sincerely,<BR><I><A HREF="mailto:jacobo@arcytech.org">Jacobo
