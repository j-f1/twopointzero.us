that yields a stable population balance, run it several times and observe what 
happens. Observe the ratio of the number of squirrels to hawks. Observe how both 
population sizes vary over time. Observe how long the populations remain stable.</P><P>One 
of the combinations that achieves a population balance requires 60 oak trees and 
the following setup:</P><DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><TABLE BORDER="1" WIDTH="75%" BORDERCOLOR="#0033FF"><TR><TD COLSPAN=2   ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Squirrels</B></TD><TD COLSPAN=2 ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Hawks</B></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER">Quantity</TD><TD ALIGN="CENTER">Introduction

running the model with this setup, you'll see that indeed there will be stable 
population numbers for both squirrels and hawks. The numbers will stabilize at 
about 45 squirrels and 15 hawks, which gives you a ratio of 45/15 or 3 to 1 squirrels 
per hawk.</P><P>Based on the results of <A HREF="squirrels.html#exp5">experiment 
number 5</A> and on the way both populations are modeled by this program, how 
many hawks can a single oak tree sustain? Since one oak tree can sustain about 
three squirrels and the ratio of squirrels to hawks is 3 to 1, we can conclude 
that one full grown oak tree can sustain one and only one hawk. This is really 
not the same in nature so make sure to check the <A HREF="facts_hawks.html" TARGET="">Facts 
about Red-tailed Hawks</A> page.</P><P>Does this ratio make sense? When the predator-prey 
relationship is tied together very closely, it makes sense that there is a fairly 
stable ratio between the numbers of the two populations. As soon as the squirrel 
population increases, the hawk population, which in this case depends on squirrels 
for survival, follows suit. The opposite is also true: when the squirrel population 
goes down, so does the hawk population. In general, a somewhat stable ratio will 
be maintained.</P><P>Will the stability last forever? If you run the model several 
times, you'll see that the magic balance will not always work. There will be runs 
when something happens, the balance breaks, and either both populations dwindle 
down until they both disappear or only the hawk population disappears.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><APPLET

</DIV></APPLET></P><P>Can you come up with plausible explanations of how this 
can happen? I.e., what can cause the fine balance between the two populations 
to end? There can be many reasons. Perhaps one year more squirrels die than in 
a normal year because of some infection that affects squirrels or because of weather 
conditions that are too rough for the squirrels. Another reason could be that 
one year the hawks have more offspring than in normal years and most of them turn 
to be very aggressive when going after the squirrels. Any such imbalance can after 
a few years have a severe impact on the size of the populations.</P><P>You may 
have noticed that in many combinations both populations start to decline but somehow 
the squirrel population is able to recover and go back to normal while the hawks 
disappear. This could happen in real life if the squirrels are smart, experienced, 
and aware of the hawks.</P><P>To conclude this section, here are a few other combinations 
that you can use to set up the model and obtain the results shown on the table. 
Make sure to have enough water and nutrients for optimal growth of the oak trees.
