QUESTION
How many years does it take before a new oak tree
starts producing acorns?
ANSWER
If you were really sitting in the forest waiting for
an oak tree to start producing acorns you would have
to be very patient.  In the model it takes 22 years
before the seedlings produce the first acorns.  In 
reality, it might take anywhere between 20 and 40 years!
