Facts about Food Chains</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BLOCKQUOTE><P>This section 
contains a brief description of the food chains and food webs in an <A HREF="popintro.html#ecosystem"><U>ecosystem</U>.</A> 
</P><P><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Introduction</B></FONT></P><P>In an ecosystem, plants 
capture the sun's energy and use it to convert <U><A HREF="javascript:dictionary.startIt('inorganic')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" ONMOUSEOVER="dictionary.startIt ('inorganic')"
ONMOUSEOUT="dictionary.clearIt ()">inorganic</A></U> compounds into energy-rich 
<U><A HREF="javascript:dictionary.startIt('organic')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" ONMOUSEOVER="dictionary.startIt ('organic')"
ONMOUSEOUT="dictionary.clearIt ()">organic</A></U> compounds<A HREF="#note1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>. 
This process of using the sun's energy to convert minerals (such as magnesium 
or nitrogen) in the soil into green leaves, or carrots, or strawberries, is called 
photosynthesis.</P><P>Photosynthesis is only the beginning of a chain of energy 
conversions. There are many types of animals that will eat the products of the 
photosynthesis process. Examples are deer eating shrub leaves, rabbits eating 
carrots, or worms eating grass. When these animals eat these plant products, food 
energy and organic compounds are transferred from the plants to the animals. These 
animals are in turn eaten by other animals, again transferring energy and organic 
compounds from one animal to another. Examples would be lions eating deer, foxes 
eating rabbits, or birds eating worms.</P><P>This chain of energy transferring 
from one species to another can continue several more times, but it eventually 
ends. It ends with the dead animals that are broken down and used as food or nutrition 
by <U><A HREF="javascript:dictionary.startIt('bacteria')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" ONMOUSEOVER="dictionary.startIt ('bacteria')"
ONMOUSEOUT="dictionary.clearIt ()">bacteria</A></U> and <A HREF="javascript:dictionary.startIt('fungi')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" ONMOUSEOVER="dictionary.startIt ('fungi')"
ONMOUSEOUT="dictionary.clearIt ()">fungi</A>. As these organisms, referred to 
as decomposers, feed from the dead animals, they break down the complex organic 
compounds into simple nutrients. Decomposers play a very important role in this 
world because they take care of breaking down (cleaning) many dead material. There 
are more than 100,000 different types of decomposer organisms! These simpler nutrients 
are returned to the soil and can be used again by the plants. The energy transformation 
chain starts all over again.</P><P>Here is a figure showing one such food and 
energy chain: </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
                SRC="images/food_chain.jpg" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></P><P><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Names 
and word definitions</B></FONT></P><P><B>Producers.</B> Organisms, such as plants, 
that produce their own food are called autotrophs. The autotrophs, as mentioned 
before, convert inorganic compounds into organic compounds. They are called producers 
because all of the species of the ecosystem depend on them.</P><P><B>Consumers.</B> 
All the organisms that can not make their own food (and need producers) are called 
heterotrophs. In an ecosystem heterotrophs are called consumers because they depend 
on others. They obtain food by eating other organisms. There are different levels 
of consumers. Those that feed directly from producers, i.e. organisms that eat 
plant or plant products are called primary consumers. In the figure above the 
grasshopper is a primary consumer.</P><P>Organisms that feed on primary consumers 
are called secondary consumers. Those who feed on secondary consumers are tertiary 
consumers. In the figure above the snake acts as a secondary consumer and the 
hawk as a tertiary consumer. Some organisms, like the squirrel are at different 
levels. When the squirrel eats acorns or fruits (which are plant product), it 
is a primary consumer; however, when it eats insects or nestling birds, is it 
is a tertiary consumer.</P><P>Consumers are also classified depending on what 
they eat.</P><P><B>Herbivores</B> are those that eat only plants or plant products. 
Example are grasshoppers, mice, rabbits, deer, beavers, moose, cows, sheep, goats 
and groundhogs.</P><P><B>Carnivores,</B> on the other hand, are those that eat 
only other animals. Examples of carnivores are foxes, frogs, snakes, hawks, and 
spiders.</P><P><B><A NAME="sq_omni"></A>Omnivores</B> are the last type and eat 
both plants (acting a primary consumers) and meat (acting as secondary or tertiary 
consumers). Examples of omnivores are:</P><UL><LI> Bears --They eat insects, fish, 
moose, elk, deer, sheep as well as honey, grass, and sedges.</LI><LI>Turtles -- 
They eat snails, crayfish, crickets, earthworms, but also lettuce, small plants, 
and algae.</LI><LI>Monkeys -- They eat frogs and lizards as well as fruits, flowers, 
and leaves.</LI><LI>Squirrels -- They eat insects, moths, bird eggs and nestling 
birds and also seeds, fruits, acorns, and nuts.</LI></UL><B><A NAME="trophic"></A>Trophic 
level.</B> The last word that is worth mentioning in this section is <A HREF="javascript:dictionary.startIt('trophic')" STYLE="text-decoration:none" ONMOUSEOVER="dictionary.startIt ('trophic')"
ONMOUSEOUT="dictionary.clearIt ()">trophic</A> level, which corresponds to the 
different levels or steps in the food chain. In other words, the producers, the 
consumers, and the decomposers are the main trophic levels.<P><B><FONT SIZE="4"><A NAME="foodwebs"></A>Food 
Webs</FONT></B></P><P>In looking at the previous picture, the concept of food 
chain looks very simple, but in reality it is more complex. Think about it. How 
many different animals eat grass? And from the <A HREF="facts_hawks.html">Facts 
about Red-tailed Hawks</A> page, how many different foods does the hawk eat? One 
doesn't find simple independent food chains in an ecosystem, but many interdependent 
and complex food chains that look more like a web and are therefore called food 
webs. A food web that shows the energy transformations in an ecosystem looks like 
this<A HREF="#note2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>: </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
                SRC="images/food_web.jpg" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></P><P>As 
you can see from this picture, food webs, with all their dependencies, can be 
very complex, but somehow nature balances things out so that food webs last a 
long time. Many species share the same habitat, their populations survive for 
many years, and they all live <I>happily</I> together.</P><P><FONT SIZE="4"><B><A NAME="pyramid"></A>The 
Ecological Pyramid</B></FONT></P><P>We described in the previous sections how 
energy and organic compounds are passed from one trophic level to the next. What 
was not mentioned is the efficiency of the transfer. In a highly efficient transfer 
almost all of the energy would be transferred -- 80% or more. In a low efficiency 
transfer very little energy would be transferred -- less than 20%. In a typical 
food chain, not all animals or plants are eaten by the next trophic level. In 
addition, there are portions or materials (such as beaks, shells, bones, etc.) 
that are also not eaten. That is why the transfer of matter and energy from one 
trophic level to the next is not an efficient one.</P><P>One way to calculate 
the energy transfer is by measuring or sizing the energy at one trophic level 
and then at the next. Calorie is a unit of measure used for energy. The energy 
transfer from one trophic level to the next is about 10%. For example, if there 
are 10,000 calories at one level, only 1,000 are transferred to the next. This 
10% energy and material transfer rule can be depicted with an ecological pyramid 
that looks like this:</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG
                SRC="images/pyramid1.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0" WIDTH="470" HEIGHT="365"> 
</P><P>This pyramid helps one visualize the fact that in an ecological system 
there need to be many producing organisms at the bottom of the pyramid to be able 
to sustain just a couple of organisms at the top. In looking at the pyramid, can 
you guess how much larger the volume of each layer is as compared to the one just 
above it? Take a guess. It might not look like it but they are close to 10 times 
larger.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Final comments</B></FONT> </P><P><B>Oaks</B> 
rate a position at or very near the top of the wildlife food chain (or bottom 
of the ecological pyramid). They are the <I>&quot;staff of life&quot;</I> for 
many wild life species. The greatest food value comes from the acorn, especially 
during the winter season when other foods are scarce.</P><P><B>Squirrels,</B> 
which are <A HREF="#sq_omni">omnivores</A>, are neither at the bottom or the top 
of the food chain. Since the feed from producers as well as primary consumers, 
one could say that they occupy two layers in the pyramid.</P><P><B>Hawks,</B> 
which are mature birds of prey, are at the top of the their food chain and of 
the ecological pyramid.</P><P>&nbsp; </P><HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="50%"><P>&nbsp;</P><P><B>References</B></P><P><FONT SIZE="2"><A NAME="note1"></A></FONT>[Note
