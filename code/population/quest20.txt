QUESTION
Can one achieve a stable population balance between the
predator and the prey?
ANSWER
The answer has to be YES!  Isn't nature wonderful?
Think about it, if there wouldn't be a combination
where both populations can co-exist, there wouldn't
be forests with both gray squirrels and red-tail 
hawks, and there are many around the world.
